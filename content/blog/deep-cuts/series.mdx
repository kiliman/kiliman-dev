This will be an on going series that takes a deep dive into how Remix works. I'll
take you on a tour back stage as we explore the request pipeline from client to
server and back. I'll show how nested layouts work under the covers. And we'll
take a peak behind the curtain to see how the compiler separates the server code
from the client bundles.
